# Retail Sales Analysis (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data using Power BI with a strong emphasis on data quality, validated analysis, and clear business storytelling. The goal was to transform raw, incomplete transactional data into reliable insights that support sales and profitability decisions.

---

## Dataset
- Approximately 1 million transaction records
- Raw data contained missing values in sales, cost, and profit fields
- Transactions were classified using a Valid Transaction Flag
- Analysis was structured to prevent misleading insights from incomplete data

Due to GitHub file size limits, a representative sample dataset is included in this repository. The full dataset is hosted externally.

## Analytical Approach
The project followed a structured workflow:

1. **Data Quality Assessment**
   - Identification of missing and invalid records
   - Revenue coverage analysis
   - Transaction validation logic

2. **Sales Performance Analysis**
   - Sales trend analysis over time
   - Category, product, and regional performance
   - Identification of key revenue drivers

3. **Profitability Analysis**
   - Profit and margin analysis using validated transactions only
   - Loss concentration analysis by category

## Dashboard Structure
The Power BI report contains three pages:

1. **Data Quality Overview**  
   Focused on transparency, completeness, and reliability of the data.

2. **Sales Performance & Drivers**  
   Focused on revenue trends and structural drivers of sales.

3. **Profit & Performance**  
   Focused on profitability trends and performance efficiency.
